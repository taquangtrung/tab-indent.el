Tab-indent.el
================

Use "Tab", "Shift-Tab" keys to indent, unindent a block of code in Emacs

* The original code was made by Ignacio: http://ignaciopp.wordpress.com/2009/06/17/emacs-indentunindent-region-as-a-block-using-the-tab-key/ 

* I slightly modified a bit so that the "Tab" key also works normally in minibuffer mode of Emacs.
